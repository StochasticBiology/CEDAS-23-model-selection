# CEDAS-23-model-selection
Model selection examples and exercises for CEDAS 2023 summer school

`mombf-vignette.R` is an adapted code vignette from the `mombf` library (1), demonstrating a simple example of Bayesian model selection.

`chem-data.csv` is synthetic chemical data describing the rate of product formation as a function of reactant concentration (powers of reactant concentration are also given)

`mt-data.csv` and `pt-data.csv` is bioinformatic data on mtDNA and ptDNA gene retention and associated possible predictors, taken from (2).

`slides/` contains the TeX for the lecture slides (`cedas-23.tex`) and most images therein; those under different licenses are omitted. `cedas.R` generates example plots for these slides.
